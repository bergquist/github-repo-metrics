We investigated and went through, but Grafana seems to be the source of the biggest part of the issue as it created its own custom form field for the query editor and assume cursor position.\r\n\r\nRead first comments of the above-mentioned bug is probably better, but to summarize: the font Firefox is using is making automatic ligatures, and for every ligatures character, there's an increasing gap between where the cursor really is and where user is seeing it.

By that said, we probably want to split this up in smaller issues if we decide that this is a good way forward.\r\n\r\nIn general the *Conditions editor* for alerts are very similar to a rule/conditional formatting editor functionality and would probably fit quite nice with a few modifications. This is something to take into considerations when implementing this.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1668778/38030188-3779b9f4-3298-11e8-92f8-b2da14b54be3.png)\r\n\r\n### Conditional rules evaluator\r\n\r\nA panel needing conditional formatting shouldn't need to implement their own solution for evaluating conditional rules thus making this a core component/helper library is a must. \r\nIt would be nice if this component also could return a list of rule types that it supports.\r\n\r\nExamples of rule types:\r\n* Value is empty\r\n* Value is not empty\r\n* Text contains\r\n* Text does not contain\r\n* Text starts with\r\n* Text ends with\r\n* Text is exactly\r\n* Date is\r\n* Date is before\r\n* Date is after\r\n* Greater than\r\n* Greater than or equal to\r\n* Less than\r\n* Less than or equal to\r\n* Is equal to\r\n* Is not equal to\r\n* Is between\r\n* Is not between\r\n\r\n### Singlestat panel - colorize background/value\r\n\r\nChanges here compared to current functionality is that \r\n* it allow you to define unlimited amount of color formatting's compared to today's maximum of three.\r\n* it allow support for coloring based on empty/non-empty values\r\n* it allow support for coloring based on string/text values\r\n* it allow support for coloring based on date/duration values\r\n\r\n#### UX mockup/example to underline functionality needed/wanted\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1668778/38031398-639900aa-329b-11e8-9d46-6f796ce3b944.png)\r\n\r\n### Table panel - colorize cells/values/rows\r\n\r\nChanges here compared to current functionality is that \r\n* it allow you to define unlimited amount of color formatting's compared to today's maximum of three.\r\n* it allow support for coloring based on empty/non-empty values\r\n* it allow support for coloring based on string/text values\r\n* it allow support for coloring based on date/duration values\r\n* it allow support for coloring a row based on a hidden/non-rendered column\r\n\r\nCurrently you can define thresholds for each defined *Column style*. Maybe we want to continue having this possibility since we can make smart decisions of what columns to apply the conditional formatting rules to. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand it quite weird to continue using the column styles since they're basically provides options for how to render column cells/convert raw column value using specific data types and options etc. Regarding coloring we currently supports cell/value/row which affects cells or rows and rules are evaluated based on  the raw data returned from data source query, that is not after conversion/options. In the mockup below there's a really simple UX which basically would scan all rows and columns returned from data source query to apply conditional formatting.\r\n\r\nOne option to having conditional formatting inside the *Column style* tab would be to allow conditional formatting rules to be applied per columns basis under a specific tab. Basically like the mockup below but with additional logic to decide which columns the rules should be applied to. This solution have an advantage because it can support conditional formatting of rows based on a hidden/non-rendered column.\r\n\r\n#### UX mockup/example to underline functionality needed/wanted\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1668778/38029792-231220c4-3297-11e8-98d6-fe3d827edaf3.png)\r\n\r\n### Forward compatibility\r\n\r\nAny changes needed to existing Singlestat and Table panel JSON models should be forward compatible, meaning that existing saved dashboards with Singlestat/Table panel having coloring/threshold enabled should be migrated/converted to the new solution when such a dashboard is rendered."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-03-28T13:29:15Z","org":{"id":7195757,"login":"grafana","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/grafana","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195757?"}},{"id":"7447715027","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":8655789,"login":"codecov-io","display_login":"codecov-io","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codecov-io","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8655789?"},"repo":{"id":15111821,"name":"grafana/grafana","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/11417","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/11417/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/11417/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/11417/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/11417","id":309359528,"number":11417,"title":"removed

I finally have accurate Prometheus graphs. For my data (e.g. network error counters), rate extrapolation doesn't work well.\r\n\r\nI tried posting [this experience report](https://gist.github.com/jgracenin/3d4d5849f34f4cc9c676f2cc5b7faef2) to the prometheus-dev thread (even after becoming a sub), but my reply is always deleted (spam?). I also mentioned it in their IRC yesterday, but I was ignored. I give up :)\r\n\r\nFWIW, Borgmon doesn't extrapolate rates. From the [Google SRE book alerting chapter](https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/practical-alerting.html):\r\n> The rate() function takes the enclosed expression and returns the total delta divided by the total time between the earliest and latest values.\r\n\r\nIt's unclear if both approaches are needed in the future, but xrate is a substantial improvement over rate for my data.\r\n\r\nSince they closed your PR, I'm now just going to promote xrate/xincrease in place of the original rate funcitons in my 2.0.0 build. Hopefully, rate will improve someday and I'll just use the official release.
