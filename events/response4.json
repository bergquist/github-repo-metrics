I believe it to be a bug, based on the following factors:\r\n- Probably unintended change in behavior with respect to Grafana 4\r\n- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` denotes the ISO 8601 format for UTC time. The `Z` should not ordinarily be interpreted as \"timezone offset\" - though I appreciate there is some ambiguity here"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/comments/377067103","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/11427#issuecomment-377067103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/11427","id":377067103,"user":{"login":"svet-b","id":12831860,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12831860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b","html_url":"https://github.com/svet-b","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svet-b/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T23:06:58Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T23:06:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Just looked into this further. Looks like the change was actually implemented between 4.3 and 4.4.\r\n\r\n_Before_ (https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v4.3.x/public/app/core/utils/file_export.ts#L33):\r\n```\r\ndataArr[0][cIndex] = new Date(dp[1]).toISOString();\r\n```\r\n\r\n_After_ (https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/v4.4.x/public/app/core/utils/file_export.ts#L36):\r\n```\r\ndataArr[0][cIndex] = moment(dp[1]).format(dateTimeFormat);\r\n```\r\nI imagine there was some discussion on this at the time, and apologies for possibly having missed that, but I wanted to make sure this is indeed the intended functionality?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with moment.js, it doesn't appear to be possible to force display of timestamps as UTC simply by adjusting the format string. And indeed, the `Z` format character simply translates to a numerical timezone offset (per https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/).\r\n\r\nI have a couple of suggestions of how to get around this, and wouldn't mind looking at submitting a PR if these sound attractive:\r\n1) In export UI, add an option to convert the moment object to UTC (by applying `.utc()` method) prior to formatting to string.\r\n2) As (1), but apply UTC conversion automatically if dashboard is set to display as UTC, and leave as local time otherwise\r\n3) In export UI, add an option to convert to ISO string (by applying `.toISOString()` method), rather than `.format()`. This works as expected for moment objects, and recreates the 4.3

In the export, \"Time Date Format\" was kept set to the default `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`\r\n\r\n**What was the expected result?**\r\nI expected the CSV export to contain ISO 8601 timestamps in UTC, e.g. `2018-03-26T19:14:00Z`.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed the behavior on an older Grafana 4.3 instance I was running previously, from where this dashboard was imported.\r\n\r\n**What happened instead?**\r\nThe CSV export contained timestamps in local time, including timezone offset. E.g. `2018-03-26T15:14:00-04:00`. Attempts to work around this, such as removing the `Z` from the \"Time Date Format\" simply removed the timezone offset (e.g. leaving `2018-03-26T15:14:00` in local time).\r\n\r\nThis behavior persists whether exporting series as rows or columns, and no matter whether \"Excel CSV Dialect\" is ticked or not.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is also described in https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/10497, but somehow tagged as a \"feature request\". I believe it to be a bug, based on the following factors:\r\n- Probably unintended change in behavior with respect to Grafana 4\r\n- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` denotes the ISO 8601 format for UTC time. The `Z` should not ordinarily be interpreted as \"timezone offset\" - though I appreciate there is some ambiguity
