are three things that need to be solved to support Prometheus histograms in the heatmap panel.\r\n\r\n### Transform the histogram result into the format expected by the heatmap panel\r\nPrometheus stores the values of each bucket incrementally. So we have to decrement each bucket in the Prometheus data source before sending it to the heatmap panel. I started working on that in a branch but it's out of sync with master. The transform function can be found at https://github.com/bergquist/grafana/blob/prom_heatmap/public/app/plugins/datasource/prometheus/result_transformer.ts#L21 and one test for the function can be found at https://github.com/bergquist/grafana/blob/prom_heatmap/public/app/plugins/datasource/prometheus/specs/result_transformer.ts#L17 Those can be used to get started quickly. \r\n\r\n### We need to handle Prometheus `+Inf` serie. \r\nIn Prometheus, each histogram contains a serie named `+Inf` which is used whenever a value does not find in any other predefined bucket. This serie can help you decide if you should are more buckets or not. I'm not sure how to visualize this serie, if at all. If we decide to not show it we should remove it from the response when transforming the result into heat map format. \r\n\r\n### Exponential buckets \r\nUsing the helper method in the Prometheus client libs you usually choose between Linear and exponential buckets. Would be great if the heat map panel could support this as well log base scales. \r\n\r\n\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/comments/376796090","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/10009#issuecomment-376796090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/10009","id":376796090,"user":{"login":"alexanderzobnin","id":4932851,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4932851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexanderzobnin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexanderzobnin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-28T07:57:09Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T07:57:09Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@neopaf it's a default format for heatmap :)  not sure problem was in the format because it only converts histogram buckets from cumulative to regular.

thank you for contributing to Grafana! \r\n\r\nI had to make some changes to make the solution more similar to the singlestat value mappings and did some refactoring. Due to this I rebased your commit and my commit before merging it to master (95a4d61). Your commit unfortunately got rewritten as 67f0382222afa69fc8bc4690a4ef3770ac9449c1 leaving the author unchanged (@aapanasevich-sc), but replaced you as committer with me. My apologies for this.\r\n\r\nThis is merged so I'm closing this PR
