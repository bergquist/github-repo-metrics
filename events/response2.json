Grafana version are you using?** 5.0.1 \r\n**What datasource are you using?** InfluxDB\r\n**What OS are you running grafana on?** Linux\r\n\r\n**What did you do?**\r\nIn a dashboard that's set to display charts in UTC, I did a CSV export. In the export, \"Time Date Format\" was kept set to the default `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`\r\n\r\n**What was the expected result?**\r\nI expected the CSV export to contain ISO 8601 timestamps in UTC, e.g. `2018-03-26T19:14:00Z`.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed the behavior on an older Grafana 4.3 instance I was running previously, from where this dashboard was imported.\r\n\r\n**What happened instead?**\r\nThe CSV export contained timestamps in local time, including timezone offset. E.g. `2018-03-26T15:14:00-04:00`. Attempts to work around this, such as removing the `Z` from the \"Time Date Format\" simply removed the timezone offset (e.g. leaving `2018-03-26T15:14:00` in local time).\r\n\r\nThis behavior persists whether exporting series as rows or columns, and no matter whether \"Excel CSV Dialect\" is ticked or not.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is also described in https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/10497, but somehow tagged as a \"feature request\". I believe it to be a bug, based on the following factors:\r\n- Probably unintended change in behavior with respect to Grafana 4\r\n- `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` denotes the ISO 8601 format for UTC time. The `Z` should not ordinarily be interpreted as \"timezone offset\" - though I appreciate there is some ambiguity

Let's have an example:\n\nGiven metric names\ncity1.services.user1.bananas_eaten.count\ncity1.services.user1.apples_delivered.count\ncity1.gates.carts_passed.count\n\nI want to capture template variables `$user` and `$city`, where grabbing possible user values is easy:\njust a graphite query for `*.services.user*`. Now, I want `$city` to be limited by the `$user`. \n\nHere I'm stuck. I can ask the graphite API: `https://my.graphite/graphite/metrics/expand?query=city*.services.$user` and use a regex to pull out the values. But how do I do that in Grafana? All I can do is `find` metrics, which only gives me the last node of the metric name.\n\nCan the template query mechanism somehow expose the full metric name so I could decide which values to construct out of it?\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/comments/377217772","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/2343#issuecomment-377217772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana/issues/2343","id":377217772,"user":{"login":"rmontgomery2018","id":11180174,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11180174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018","html_url":"https://github.com/rmontgomery2018","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmontgomery2018/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T12:21:12Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T12:21:12Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"+1\r\nThis woul definitely help out with our dashboards.

\"Dashboard Links\"; I'm referring to the links available under \"Dashboard Settings\" -> \"Links\".\r\n\r\nSuppose i have 3 dashboard named: \"1) DASHBOARD1\", \"2) DASHBOARD2\", \"3) DASHBOARD3\" all with the same tag named \"TAG\".\r\n\r\nIn each dashboard i have configured the \"Dashboard Links\" as:\r\n\r\nType: dashboards\r\nWith tags: TAG\r\nAs dropdown: Checked\r\nTitle: TITLE\r\nTime Range: Checked\r\nVariable values: Checked\r\nOpen in new tab: Not Checked\r\n\r\nThe link of each dashboard showed in the dropdown menu (top right) is:\r\n\r\nhttp://MY_IP/dashboard/db/1-DASHBOARD1i?from=1503597600000&to=1504202400000\r\nhttp://MY_IP/dashboard/db/2-DASHBOARD2?from=1503597600000&to=1504202400000\r\nhttp://MY_IP/dashboard/db/3-DASHBOARD3?from=1503597600000&to=1504202400000\r\n\r\nwhile the link of each dashboard in the main navigation menu (top left) is:\r\n\r\nhttp://MY_IP/d/UNIQUE_ID1/1-DASHBOARD1\r\nhttp://MY_IP/d/UNIQUE_ID2/2-DASHBOARD2\r\nhttp://MY_IP/d/UNIQUE_ID2/3-DASHBOARD3\r\n\r\nWhen i click on the dashboard for opening \"2) DASHBOARD2\" the system instead open \"1) DASHBOARD1\"; The link:\r\n\r\nhttp://MY_IP/dashboard/db/2-DASHBOARD2?from=1503597600000&to=1504202400000\r\n\r\nbring me to \"1) DASHBOARD1\". \r\n\r\nUsing the main navigation menu link:\r\n\r\nhttp://MY_IP/d/UNIQUE_ID2/2-DASHBOARD2\r\n\r\nbring me to correctly to \"2) DASHBOARD2\".\r\n\r\nThere is a bug on how \"Dashboard Links\" maps, inside the database, the page name to the actual page to load; maybe the dashboard links should have the id in the path like in the main navigation menu to avoid this problem.\r\n\r\n\"2) DASHBOARD2\" was created as a copy of \"1) DASHBOARD1\", using the save as functionality on \"1) DASHBOARD1\".\r\n\r\nSometimes also \"Dashboard Links\" return ad error saying that the dashboard has not been found.\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-03-29T09:56:16Z","org":{"id":7195757,"login":"grafana","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/grafana","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7195757?"}},{"id":"7452877166","type":"CreateEvent","actor":{"id":23470681,"login":"Ijin08","display_login":"Ijin08","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ijin08","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23470681?"},"repo":{"id":15111821,"name":"grafana/grafana","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/grafana"},"payload":{"ref":"graph_tooltip_to_ts","ref_type":"branch","master_branch":"master","description":"The

5.0.3\r\nGrafana host: Windows 7 Pro, 64 bit\r\nMySQL server: Maria DB 10.2, Debian Jessie 64 bit\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\nMy data source is a MySQL table of network ping tests, collected hourly, covering several years worth of data. \r\n\r\nTable Spec:\r\n```\r\n+-------------+-------------------------------\r\n| Field       | Type\r\n+-------------+-------------------------------\r\n| id          | int(10) unsigned\r\n| source      | enum(<list of source hostnames>)\r\n| target      | enum(<list of ping targets>)\r\n| packet_size | smallint(4)\r\n| start       | datetime\r\n| min         | decimal(5,1)        \r\n| mean        | decimal(5,1)\r\n| max         | decimal(5,1)\r\n| %_lost      | decimal(5,1)\r\n+-------------+--------------------------------\r\n```\r\nGrafana Query Spec:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  MAX(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(`start`)) as time_sec,\r\n  AVG(`%_lost`) as value,\r\n  '%_lost' as metric\r\nFROM `ping`\r\nWHERE $__timeFilter(`start`)\r\nGROUP BY $__timeGroup(start, $interval)\r\nORDER BY $__timeGroup(start, $interval) ASC\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Issue**\r\nThe the default set of values for a variable of type **_interval_** is: 1m,10m,30m,1h,6h,12h,1d,7d,14d,30d\r\n\r\nHowever if I select any of the intervals expressed in days, the Grafana query fails and the display chart is blank.\r\n\r\nLooking at the chart specification you can see that Grafana's generation of the SQL query fails for an interval expressed in days such as \"7d\".\r\n\r\nIt looks as if the `$__timeGroup()` function can't handle intervals in days. As the default intervals include values in days I interpret this as a bug, but if this is consdered to be `$__timeGroup()` working as designed, then please mark this as an enhancement
